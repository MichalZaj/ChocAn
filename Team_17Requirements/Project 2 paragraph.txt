
The ChocAn System includes hardware for user interfaces that interact with the
computerized processing software at the ChocAn Data Center. Providers, managers,
and operators at the Data Center interact with individual terminals that include
a keyboard and a screen. In order for these terminals to access the ChocAn data
files stored on disks, the processing software validates each user and reflects 
that computerized validation on their specific terminal. The ChocAn system also
interacts with Acme Accounting Services computers and banking computers. 
Additionally, the system is connected to a timer that automatically triggers the 
main accounting procedure. Other computerized processes include printing/sending reports 
as email attachments, totaling fees, and the validation process for the users.
