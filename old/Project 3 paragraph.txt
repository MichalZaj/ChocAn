Our design of the ChocAn system demonstrates high cohesion and low coupling, as is associated with "good design". 
When we look at the cohesion of our design, the classes are made up of several intentional methods that act on the same 
data structure, therefore exhibiting a high degree of informational cohesion. Our design minimizes the number of classes that
have access to each data set, of which is organized in their own classes. This demonstrates low coupling because there is 
no content or common coupling. Overall, our classes are designed with their own attributes that have methods with one action, 
operation, or purpose with those attributes.
