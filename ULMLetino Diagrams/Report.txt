		<p><h3>ChocAn Data Processing Software Solution</h3></p>

		<p>ChocAn needs processing software that can perform a variety of use cases for all its users: providers, managers, operators, and interact with a timer. 
This software will be able to read data from a provider’s terminal, a manager’s terminal, and be used in interactive mode by operators at the data center. Our goals are only within the scope of the ChocAn data processing software 
and will not extend to communication software, the design of the terminals, software needed for the Acme Accounting Services, or implementing the EFT data. Our report deliverable includes a glossary, UML Use Case Diagram, use case descriptions, 
and our statistics of the group as we work to plan and develop the software. The glossary includes key terms critical to a comprehensive view of the system. The UML Use Case diagram is a visual representation of the goals of the system and the users' interaction with it. 
The descriptions include an enumerated explanation of each use case laid out in the diagram. And, finally the statistics included will show each member of this team's credentials and contribution to the project. Our submitter is Cristina Paier, and was responsible for creating this report; 
all other team members will submit a report with their individual UML Use Case diagram included and contribution table.</p>
